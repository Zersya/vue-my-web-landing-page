          The first time I become a developer is focused on Game Development. I also trying to create a simple web application. That's the reason why I choose Informatic Engineering for my degree.
          When I become a college student, I have participated in any National and International robotic contest.
          I have learned so many things, and now I can use that for myself, I like to become a developer, its because there is a logical thing can be implemented when I developing any games/application.
          Now I was focused on developing Mobile and Web application, I use Flutter for developing Hybrid mobile app, Java/Android for Native mobile app and Laravel, Angular, Vue for developing a web app.
